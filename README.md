Playground for me to learn some new tech

## [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/learn)

### Advantages

- Simple client side navigation/routing. (Avoiding page refresh)
- Code splitting & prefetching
  - Each page only loads whatâ€™s necessary
    - Homepage loads quickly
    - Pages become isolated. (If one page throws an error, the rest of the application would still work)
  - Automatically prefetches the code for the linked page in the background
    - The next page transition will be near-instant.
